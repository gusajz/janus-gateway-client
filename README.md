# janus-gateway-client

Wrapper for [janus,js](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/js-modules.html) library with typescript definitions. 

## Goals

* Base library installed directly from original repository.
* Export as module (as opposed to global variable as in the original library).
* Include Typescript definitions (WIP).

## Installation
